*Application that consumes themoviedb.org API.*

# About the project

It was written using Ionic framework. It is mostly an study project but it is a great reference for future projects using that framework. One of the main goals was write reusable, testable and maintainable code adopting DRY concept as much as possible.

# Dependencies

It uses *npm* and *bower* as its main package managers. For cordova pluggins, a `cordova prepare` command should do the work, but if not, the project is using only `cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing` plugin so far.
